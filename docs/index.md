title: Introduction
# Welcome

So you're looking to get started using __Reddit Media Downloader__, huh? Great!

There are just a few steps to get everything running, and I promise they're simple. 
Everything you'll need should be documented on this site.

The rest of these pages will help advanced users fine-tune RMD to work exactly the way they want it to.

## Step 1: Installing
To start using Reddit Media Downloader, you first need to download and install it. 

Check out [the setup guide](./Getting_Started/Installing.md) to get started.

## Step 2: Configuring
Once you've installed RMD, you'll want to grant it access to read Reddit through your account.

Read [the Configuration Guide](./Getting_Started/Running_&_Configuring.md) to learn more.

## Step 3: Add Sources
You're almost ready to start downloading! The final step is the easiest - just tell RMD what to download.
This can be done easily within the WebUI's "Sources" tab.

The [Sources documentation](./Getting_Started/Sources.md) explains more about what each Source is.


## Advanced Customization
There are many options to further customize the posts RMD finds, the way downloads are saved, and more. 
These guides can be found in the "Advanced" section. 

Notably, [Filters](Advanced_Usage/Filters.md) and [Settings](Advanced_Usage/Settings.md) are worth checking out!
