title: FAQ


## Why does RMD only find 1000 results?
Though RMD can theoretically support any amount of results, Reddit limits most resources to the first 1000 results.
This means that most User/Subreddit/etc Sources will be limited to 1000 results, maximum.

The [PushShift Sources](Sources.md#pushshift-subreddit-submissions) do not have this problem, and are recommended if you need more than the 1000 post limit.


## I have a bug or feature request.
+ I'm always open to bug reports or feature requests, so [hit me up](https://github.com/shadowmoose/RedditDownloader/issues/new/choose)!
