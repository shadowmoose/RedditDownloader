# Installing RMD

*It only takes three simple steps to get RMD running, and they are outlined here.*

## Step 1: Install Python
**[Get Python 3.5+ Installed.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** The latest version will do. 

## Step 2: Download RMD
Download this program, either using git or by [clicking here](https://github.com/shadowmoose/RedditDownloader/releases/latest) *(Latest Release is suggested)*. If you download the zip, unpack it.

## Step 3: Install Packages
**Install dependencies:** launch a terminal inside wherever you saved the program folder, and run the line:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

*Windows Note: You can open a terminal in the folder by holding shift and right-clicking the folder (not the files inside it), then selecting "Open Window Here"*

*Note: If there are multiple Python installations on your machine, make sure you're running pip3.*


### You're Done!
