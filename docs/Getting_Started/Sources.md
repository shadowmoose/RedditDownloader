title: Sources

# What is a Source?
_A "Source" is, simply, represents a place from Reddit where RMD should look for posts. 
You can individually configure Sources to pull Submissions or Comments from all over Reddit, 
including Subreddits, User Profiles, Multireddits, and your own Liked/Saved feed._

## Using Sources
By default, RMD will include a Source to find & download your personal Liked & Saved posts. 
This is the default behavior since RMD's release.

To change this in the WebUI, simply remove that source and add new ones. 
You can have as many as you'd like - including duplicates of the same Source type.

Most sources have some options to let you sort and filter the posts they find. 
If you'd like to filter them further, [add as many extra Filters](../Advanced_Usage/Filters.md) as you need. 
Filters are applied per-Source, to allow maximum customization.

You give each Source a unique name when you set them up, and - if you desire - this alias can be embedded into 
the final file output paths [(See "Output Format" in Settings.md)](../Advanced_Usage/Settings.md) to further differentiate 
the various sources.
