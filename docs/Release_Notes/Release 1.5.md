# Release 1.5

This version sees the implementation of Sources & Filters.

With this release RMD's functionality has been massively expanded, going beyond pulling personal liked/saved
posts. RMD now sports a full engine for multiple different sources of posts, as well as filters to weed out
unwanted content.

### Change Log (Mostly Complete)
