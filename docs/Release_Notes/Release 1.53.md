# Release 1.53

This version patches a few small bits of code, and implements a new Filter option.

Want to limit the sites you download from? Now with pattern support, you can do just that!

Thanks to *will76* for the suggestion.

### Change Log

+ Now supports filtering out any URLs that don't match a given pattern.
+ Updating the program and running without a restart will now always properly reload the main file.
