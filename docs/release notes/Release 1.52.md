# Happy New Year, Everyone!

While I was away, a few of you found a couple bugs that I deemed important enough to push a small release for.

I'm back now, and a few new features are in the works. In the mean time, this update will make sure the client can fully launch itself from scratch, as well as download posts with names that normally exceed the Windows filename limit.

Special thanks to GreysenEvans & will76 for reporting and bugfixing these issues.
