# Release 1.5:

This version sees the implementation of Sources & Filters.

With this release RMD's functionality has been massively expanded, going beyond pulling personal liked/saved
posts. RMD now sports a full engine for multiple different sources of posts, as well as filters to weed out
unwanted content.

### Change Log (Mostly Complete):

+ Now supports Sources
+ Now supports Filters
+ Manifest now properly implemented.
+ Wizard to handle all setup and config added.
+ Patched potential bug in Updater (the bug may prevent automatic updates to this version).
+ Adjusted output coloring to (hopefully) support more platforms.
+ Added GitHub site for examples and guides.
