**Assuming everything's up to date, these are the currently supported sources for Submissions/Comments.**

*Note that it is possible to have more than one of the same type of source.*

*Sources are given a unique alias when you set them up, and - if you desire - this alias can be embedded into 
the final file output paths [(See "Output Format" in Settings.md)](../Settings.md) to further differentiate 
the various sources.*

# Supported Sources:

+ __Your Reddit Front Page__
  + Supports all standard methods of sorting.
  + Personalized to the authorized account.


+ __Your Upvoted and/or Saved Submissions & Comments__
  + Scan all the posts you've personally Upvoted or Saved.
  + For more flexible configuration, see the *User Upvoted/Saved* source.
  + For Comments, only comments you've Saved can be located.


+ __User Upvoted/Saved Posts & Comments__
  + Allows you to choose a Username, and scan their Upvoted and/or Saved posts
  + This Source only works for Users who are set to Public, or for your own account.
  + This Source has more functionality than the *Personal* Source
  + I suggest using this one on personal accounts instead, if you need advanced configuration.

  + Provide a username and multireddit name to use.
