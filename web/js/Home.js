					It's still in super-early Alpha right now, but I appreciate the testing!
				</p>
				<p>
					It still needs a ton of styling, but if you're confused about a setting,
					hovering over it will give you more information.
				</p>
				<p>
					Head over to the other two tabs above, and use them to configure everything!

					<strong>Keep in mind - </strong>
					settings related to the UI will require you to restart before they take effect!
